# Minecraft-The-End-Poem

## A STORY FOR THE END CREDITS OF MINECRAFT.

### Notes:

1. I’ve given the two voices different colours, but you might prefer to differentiate them in some other way. (Perhaps with italics, or bold text, or different shades of the same colour…)

2. The voices address the player directly, using the player’s name, a couple of times. So I’m assuming you can insert their player name where it says ((insert player name here)). If that’s a problem, just tell me, and I can rewrite it.

3. Sometimes the voices say things that the player can’t read or understand. I’ve put in a few mysterious symbols at those points (**??§§), but I’m happy for you to come up with a more visually interesting way of indicating this.

4. I use English spelling throughout, but if you want to change it to US English (“color” instead of “colour”, etc) that’s fine by me.

OK, that’s it! Hope you find interesting.
